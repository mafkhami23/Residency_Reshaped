![Kano Overview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fef7aa5-0b87-4ef2-b09e-d84dadc5a654)

## 🧠 Overview  
This project demonstrates the application of the **Kano Model** within a real estate development context to extract actionable insights from users. Built with a blend of **quantitative and qualitative research**, this analysis helps decision-makers prioritize features based on **true customer value**, improving both user experience and business outcomes.

> 🔍 **Why it matters for Design Researchers:**  
This project exemplifies how structured primary research, supported by behavioral data, can **accelerate learning**, **shape product roadmaps**, and **influence stakeholders**—aligning perfectly with Capital One’s mission to embed humanity into strategic decisions.

## 💡 What is the Kano Model?

The **Kano Model** classifies features into five categories:

| Category      | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Must-Have** | Basic expectations. Their absence causes dissatisfaction, but their presence doesn’t increase satisfaction. |
| **Performance** | The better these are, the happier users are. |
| **Attractive (Delighters)** | Unexpected features that pleasantly surprise users. |
| **Indifferent** | Features with little or no effect on satisfaction. |
| **Reverse** | Features some users actively dislike. |
